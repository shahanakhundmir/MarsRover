## Mars Rover Challenge :oncoming_automobile:

### Cases to check
collision - if there is more than one rover then report error if there is a collision
Before the rover starts its journey and after each move, check that the rover is still on the plateau
If initial plateau coordinates are (0,0) thrown an error
Check initital compass direction is N, S, E or W
Check that move is L, R or M 
Maximum number of rovers deployed at any one time is 3

If there are multiple rovers on a plateau, the position of each must be maintained to ensure no collisions occur
