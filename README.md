## Mars Rover Challenge :oncoming_automobile:

### Cases to check
:star: Collision - if the current rover is at the same position that a previous rover mission ended with, then a collision has occured
  Print a message about the collision and abort the mission

:star: Before the rover starts its journey and after each move, check that the rover is still on the plateau
  if not then print an error message and abort the mission

:star: If initial plateau coordinates are (0,0) an error has occured and the mission cannot continue

:star: Check initital compass direction is N, S, E or W

:star: Check that move is L, R or M 


### Testing
:star: Tests have been carried out on isolated functions

:star: Thorough testing of edge cases, including collision, valid inputs and the rover remaining on the plateau

:star: Testing checks if missions are aborted and error messages returned

:star: If more than one rover is on a mission, a list of outputs is returned

:star: Output is a dictionary item for each rovers final position, with coordinates and compass direction

:star: Error messages are string with Mission aborted and reason why.
